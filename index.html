        <h2 class="titulo">The influence in the 20th and 21st centuries</h2>
        <p>Pop art has had an indelible influence on the visual landscape of art and design in the 20th and 21st
          centuries. This movement, which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, was heavily inspired by graphic design
          elements and techniques, and is still a major influence in the world of art and design today. From its
          roots in advertising and the commercialization of everyday objects to its bold, vibrant, and often
          humorous visuals, pop art has been an integral part of graphic design for decades.</p>
        <p>Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and James Rosenquist are just a few of the many American pop artists who
          worked in the commercial art industry prior to becoming famous. As a result, they were capable of
          combining both high art and popular culture. Pop art in modern graphic design is represented by a work
          created by a designer who was influenced by the movement.</p>
        <p>The term “pop art” refers to an art movement that advocated and chastised the commercial arts. Pop art
          has been incorporated into the design and advertising of graphic art in recent years.</p>
        <p>Pop art is heavily influenced by graphic design because it relies heavily on the use of recognizable
          shapes, colors, and typography. Pop art also utilizes a variety of visual elements, including photography,
          text, and illustration, to create an artistic epresentation of popular culture.</p>
        <p>Graphic design is used to bridge the gap between the physical and the digital, enabling artists to create
          visual messages that are
          more engaging and memorable. Graphic design allows the artist to craft a message that is more easily
          identifiable and can be used to communicate a message in a more interesting manner. By utilizing the
          principles of graphic design, pop art can express a message more clearly, making it more impactful and
          memorable.</p>

        <h2 class="titulo">Relationship Between Graphic Design<br> And Pop Culture</h2>
        <p>Pop culture, in general, refers to the collection of images, ideas, stories, attitudes, and perspectives
          of a specific period. Using certain technologies, color, design aspects, or even web content as a
          reference to pop culture can all be considered a good thing in web design. The symbiotic relationship
          between pop culture and design can be easily argued.
          <br>A responsive design, an omnichannel business model, and a mobile application are three of the most popular
          design trends in pop culture. When developing an item for our audience, we must first determine what
          references we intend to make.

        <h2 class="titulo" id="fifthSection">Pop Art Style Today</h2>
        <p>Pop art style has evolved significantly over the years and continues to be an important part of modern
          culture. Today, pop art is often used in advertising and fashion to add a sense of fun and energy to a
          product or brand. Pop art is also used in interior design, often featuring bright colors, bold patterns,
          and whimsical characters. Pop art is also a popular choice for tattoos, often featuring vibrant and
          eye-catching designs. Overall, pop art style is still alive and well in the 21st century, and continues
          to
          be a source of inspiration for artists around the world.</p>

        <p class="justificacao">When starting this work, I decided to choose a text whose content could be more easily
          represented graphically and would also be of personal interest to me.<br>Pop Art is an incredibly appealing
          and visually vibrant artistic movement that plays with colors and patterns, resulting in compositions that,
          despite being graphic, have a very plastic quality. Being one of my favorite artistic movements that I
          identify with the most, I decided to choose a text that demonstrated how its use remains relevant even
          today. This would also allow me to play with its patterns and colors, creating a more dynamic and
          distinctive layout compared to the many we encounter today.</p>
